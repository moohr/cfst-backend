# CFST-backend
A backend controller for resolving the fastest Cloudflare IP at the provincial level in China to Aliyun DNS for access optimization.     
This projects uses gRPC for client-server communications. See `proto/cfst_rpc.proto` for the full communication implementation.

This is alpha software. Use at your own risk. No warranty is provided.

## Install
1. Install the `rust` toolchain. See [here](https://rustup.rs)
2. Install sqlite3, [protoc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/).
3. `git clone https://github.com/moohr/cfst-backend.git && cd cfst-backend && cargo build --release`
4. Grab `qqwry.dat` and place it under assets/.
5. Create sqlite database:
```
$ sqlite3 aliyundns.db
CREATE TABLE records (
    record_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    isp TEXT NOT NULL,
    province TEXT NOT NULL,
);
```
6. `cargo build --release`     
   The finished build should be available at ./target/release/cfst-backend
7. Fill in `.env`

## Todo
- [ ] Add gRPC endpoints for manual interaction
- [ ] Migrate IP database to use the new CZDB format
- [ ] Add more features
- [ ] Create algorithm for allocating specific ranges for testing
